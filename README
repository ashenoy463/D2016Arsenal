///////////////////// DOOM 2016 Arsenal \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
//////////// A Sub-mod for Brutal DOOM version 21 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Important: 

This mod is designed for the official release of Brutal DOOM v21, Gold by 
Sergeant_Mark_IV, so "Sub-mods" such as Project Brutality or Black Edition 
will not work, however those based on BDv21 Gold may or may not work.

Description:

More than a simple mod, it is a thematic expansion of weapons of DOOM 2016, 
each of these have been polished in its animations, it has a system of mods, 
parkour elements, elusive function as in DOOM Eternal, Grenades Syphon and 
Hologram, etc. This changes the gameplay of Brutal DOOM to follow the same 
rules of DOOM 2016 as the armor absorbs all the damage but decreases very 
quickly, staying in continuous mobility is the tactics of survival in the 
game, and yes, it has Glory Kills (They can be alternated between BD Black 
Edition or DOOM 2016 Arsenal).

For starters, the monsters now have more dangerous and aggressive new 
variants, so it makes the game more difficult, but it also makes it 
interesting. There is no longer a single grenade like BD because now there 
are the Frag Grenades, Syphon and Hologram, each with a special function 
and good for the player's survival tactics.

It is recommended to use the new keys of the mod, since they have the 
special functions such as changing the type of grenade, the quick punch 
that also serves to detonate the Glory Kills and the weapon improvement 
selector.

The mod works correctly in Deathmatch mode and Zandronum modes, the arsenal 
of weapons has been correctly balanced in these mods, since it has been 
optimized for these. But cooperative support that solves problems with 
functions has also been implemented.

New special animations that are present in the game, like the helmet that 
Doomguy puts helmet on when starting a game or the animation that appears 
every time the time of the demon rune morph ends when it returns us to 
humans.

New animations for the functions of kick, aerial kick, sliding kick, throw 
grenade and insult, will look much better during the game, I especially 
thank Tomtefar1988 as part of the code that controls these functions come 
from its Tomtefar's Extension mod.

New Functions such as the Side-Step (works by pressing the front, back, 
right or left button twice) followed by the DOOM Eternal Trailer that will 
help the players to push themselves laterally and help him to avoid the 
damage, this will be another survival mechanic for the players that play 
in a high difficulty in the game.
